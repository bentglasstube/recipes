      <p>Hello, and welcome to my digital cookbook.  This is a living book and
      very much a work in progress.  Most of the cooking I do is smoking and
      barbecuing, so a lot of the focus is on that.  I don't think I'm an
      expert or anything but I wanted to write down my methods anyway, so I may
      as well share them.</p>
