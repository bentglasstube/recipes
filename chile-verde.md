# Chile Verde

This is a leftovers meal I make from other recipes in here.  It's the
main motivation to make too much of the other things.

## Ingredients

 * leftover [pork butt][1]
 * [salsa verde][2]
 * bacon fat (or butter if you don't have any)
 * 1 can pinto beans

## Preparation

If the pork leftovers are already pulled, that's fine.  However, it
works a little better if it's still whole.  In this case, cut it into
medium size chunks first.

In a large sauce pan, heat up some butter or bacon fat until it is
melted.  You want a good amount in there to pan fry the pork so don't be
stingy with it.  Once the fat is melted, put the pork in and let it fry
up a bit until it's crispy.

Add the salsa and beans to the pan and bring to a low simmer.  Let the
mixture all simmer for an hour so all the flavors combine.  Depending on
what rub you used for the pork, it might not be too traditionally chile
flavored at this point.  I usually throw in a bunch of cumin and mexican
oregano to fix that but you can do whatever you want.
