# Parsley Potatoes

This started as another St. Patrick's Day staple but they are so good we
make them whenever the mood strikes us now.

## Ingredients

 * 12 medium red potatoes
 * 1 bunch fresh Italian parsley
 * 4 cloves garlic
 * 1/2 C butter (1 stick)

## Preparation

Quarter the potatoes and put them in a stock pot.  Fill the pot with
enough water to cover the potatoes by a couple inches.  Heavily salt the
water.  Bring it to a boil and cook the potatoes until soft, but not
quite as soft as mashed potatoes.  They should keep their shape and not
crumble when you pierce a piece with a fork.

Whilte the potatoes cook, roughly chop the parsley.  Peel and trim the
garlic cloves, then crush them.

When the potatoes are finished cooking, rub the inside of a large bowl
with the crushed garlic cloves.  Be sure to get plenty of the garlic
oils on the bowl and if some chunks of garlic get on there, that's great
too.  Discard the garlic.

Drain the potatoes and add them to the bowl.  Divide up the stick of
butter and add it to the bowl.  I usually cut it into eight or so bits,
to help it melt faster in the hot potatoes.  Add a handful or two of the
parsley and stir it all together until the butter is melted and the
potatoes are coated.

Garnish with additional parsley as desired.
