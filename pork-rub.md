# Alan's Pork Rub

This is a versatile spice rub that you can use for all kinds of meat despite
the name.  It doesn't include any salt because you should be salting your
meat separately from the rub.

## Ingredients

 * 1/2 C chili powder
 * 1/2 C brown sugar
 * 1/4 C sweet paprika
 * 1/4 C hot paprika
 * 2 tsp fresh ground black pepper
 * 2 tsp fresh ground black mustard
 * 2 tsp garlic powder
 * 2 tsp ground cumin

## Preparation

Mix all of the things together.

## Alterations

If you are going to make something with beef, you can add 1/4 C of finely
ground coffee.  I mean you can add the coffee regardless of what you are
making but I usually reserve that for beef.

If you only have normal paprika (which is the sweet variety usually) you can
toss in a tsp or two of something spicy to add the missing heat.  A good
option is chipotle powder, but cayenne works too.  If you have half sharp
paprika, you can use 1/2 C of that in place of the two separate ones.

If you want to make some sticky barbecue such as ribs, mix this rub with two
parts brown sugar.
