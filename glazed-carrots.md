# Glazed Carrots

Another side common for St. Patrick's Day.  I don't usually like cooked
carrots but these are okay.

## Ingredients

 * 1 lb carrots
 * 2 tbsp butter
 * 1/3 C brown sugar
 * 1 C water

## Preparation

Ideally, you can get some small carrots and glaze them whole.  I don't
really see these all that often though, so you will probably want to cut
the carrots into coins or something else appropriately bite sized.  Cut
the coins diagonally for extra big coins.

Put the carrots in a medium saucepan.  Add the butter, sugar, and water
and mix everything together well.

Bring the mixture to a boil and reduce the heat to medium low.  Simmer,
uncovered, for around 20 minutes until the carrots are tender and the
liquid has mostly evaporated.  You may need to add more water as it goes
to prevent scorching.

Add salt and pepper to taste.
