# Master D's Balls

The first time I made these meatballs they were crazy spicy.  My wife
doesn't like very spicy things but she ate four of them anyway and then
had a bunch of eggnog to cool her mouth down.  They are meant to be sort
of like jalape&ntilde;o poppers in meatball form I guess.

## Ingredients

 * 1/2 lb ground beef
 * 1/2 lb hot italian sausage
 * 3-4 jalape&ntilde;os, diced
 * 1/2 shredded cheese (something like cheddar)
 * 2 tbsp [Alan's Pork Rub](/pork-rub.html)
 * 4 oz cream cheese

## Preparation

Mix everything but the cream cheese together and form into 1"
meatballs.  Flatten the meatballs and put a 1/4" cube of cream cheese in
the middle.  Reform the ball around the cream cheese.

Smoke at 225&deg;F for 90 minutes to 2 hours.  Optionally, brush with
bbq sauce around 15 minutes before they are done.
