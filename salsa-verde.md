# Salsa Verde

Tomatoes are the worst.  Make salsa with the superior tomatillo.

# Ingredients

 * 1 1/2 lbs tomatillos
 * 4 jalapeño peppers
 * 1 yellow onion
 * 6 cloves garlic
 * cilantro
 * salt
 * cumin
 * olive oil

# Preparation

Preheat the oven to 425 &deg;F and move the rack to the top.  Peel and rinse
all the tomatillos.  Cut up the onion into large chunks.  Core and seed the
jalapeños if you want a milder sauce, otherwise just cut them in half
lengthwise.  Chop the garlic cloves in half too if they are big.  You can
probably just leave them whole.  I doubt it actually matters.  Toss all
these vegetables with oil on a baking sheet and roast until soft and
slightly browned, around 30 minutes.

While that's cooking, remove the stems from the cilantro until you have
around half a cup of leaves.  Chop them coarsely.

Once the vegetables are done roasting, put them into a blender along with
the cilantro.  Add a tablespoon or so of salt and maybe a teaspoon of
cumin.  You should adjust those based on taste.  I honestly just eyeball it
and made those measurements up.  Blend until smooth.
