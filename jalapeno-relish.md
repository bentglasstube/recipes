# Jalapeño Relish

This is an awesome condiment that adds a great punch to sandwiches or
bratwursts.  Use it on everything.  Change your life.

# Ingredients

 * four green jalapeño peppers
 * two red serrano peppers
 * salt
 * apple cider vinegar

# Preparation

Wear gloves.  Don't be a dickhead and think you don't need them because it's
just jalapeños.  You don't need to prove you are tough when you make food.

If you want a mild version of the relish, start by removing the seeds and
veins of the peppers.

Chop the peppers up into small bits the size of chunks you want in your
relish.  Scoop all of the chunks into a pint mason jar or similar sized
vessel.  Add enough apple cider vinegar to cover the peppers in the jar.
Add about two tablespoons of salt on top of everything.  Close the jar up
and shake vigorously to get everything mixed together.  Put the jar in the
fridge for a day or two and enjoy.

I use a fork to just get the chunks out of the jar and leave the vinegar
behind but you can do whatever you like.
