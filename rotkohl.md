# Rotkohl

This is a traditional German side dish made of red cabbage and apples.
In fact, Rotkohl is merely the German word for red cabbage.  This recipe
makes a lot of food.  You might want to halve it, but the measurements
get a bit weird.

It's worth noting that red cabbage is *very* messy so you want to use an
apron when shredding it or it will stain all your clothes.

## Ingredients

 * 1 medium head of red cabbage, shredded
 * 3 tbsp butter
 * 1 large onion, diced
 * 3 apples, peeled, cored, and diced
 * 3 tbsp cider vinegar
 * 1 C water
 * 1 tsp salt
 * 2 tsp sugar
 * 1/2 tsp nutmeg, ground
 * 1/4 tsp cloves, ground
 * 1/4 tsp pepper, ground
 * 2 tbsp lemon juice

## Preparation

In a large pot, heat butter.  Lightly sautee the onion.  Add the cabbage
and apples and cook for a few minutes.

Add all remaining ingredients except the lemon juice.  Bring the mixter
to a simmer and cover.  Let it cook for around 30 minutes so all the
flavors combine.

The mixture at this point will be fairly juicy.  If you want to thicken
it up, you can mix 1 tbsp corn starch with cold water and add that a
little at a time until the desired thickness is achieved.
Alternatively, you can let it simmer a bit longer uncovered until the
liquid reduces to your liking.

Add lemon juice and any additional seasoning to taste.
