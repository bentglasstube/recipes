# Spicy Slaw

Put this on [pulled pork](pulled-pork.html) sandwiches.

## Ingredients

 * 1 cup water
 * 1 cup sugar
 * 2 jalapeño peppers
 * 1 lb carrots, sliced into matchsticks
 * 1 head red cabbage, cored and sliced into thin strips
 * 1 medium red onion, halved and sliced thin
 * 1 bunch radishes, sliced thin
 * 1 tsp fresh ground black pepper
 * 1 tsp mustard seed
 * ½ tsp salt
 * ¼ tsp cayenne pepper
 * 1 tsp smoked paprika
 * ¾ cup white wine vinegar

## Preparation

Place all the vegetables in a large, heat proof bowl.  Combine the water,
vinegar, sugar, and spices in a medium saucepan.  Bring to a full boil and
remove from heat.  Pour over the vegetables.  Toss to coat evenly.  Transfer the
vegetables and liquid to a container with a lid and place in the fridge
overnight.  In a pinch, you can eat it after just a couple hours, but it's best
to let it ferment.
