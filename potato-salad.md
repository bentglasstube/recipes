# Potato Salad

I hate mayonaise.  I hate "salads" which are based on mayonaise.  This
is more of a German style, vinegar based potato salad.

## Ingredients

 * 3 C potatoes, diced
 * 4 slices bacon
 * 1 small onion, diced
 * 1/4 C vinegar
 * 2 tbsp water
 * 3 tbsp sugar
 * 1 tbsp fresh parsley, chopped

## Preparation

Boil potatoes in salted water until tender, but not crumbling, around 10
minutes.  Drain and set aside.

Meanwhile, fry bacon until crisp.  Remove to a paper towel lined plate,
reserving the bacon fat.

Brown the onion in the bacon fat.  Add vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and
pepper to the pan and stir together.

Bring liquid to a boil and add potatoes and parsley.  Cook until well
mixed and heated through.  Crumble bacon and add it to the mix.
