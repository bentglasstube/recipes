# Pinquito Beans

This is the traditional side for [Santa Maria Tri-Tip](/tri-tip.html)
but you should make them whenever you feel like it because they are
good.  If you can't find pinquito beans, it's probably still good with
pinto or something too.

## Ingredients

 * 1 can piquinto beans
 * 1/4 small white onion, diced
 * 1 1/2 tsp chili powder
 * 1 clove garlic, minced
 * 1 1/2 tsp tomato paste

## Preparation

Heat oil in a pot over medium low heat.  Add the onion and chili powder
and cook for 10 minutes.  Add the garlic and good for another 5 minutes,
until the onions are soft.

Add the beans (undrained) and tomato paste to the pot.  Bring to a low
simmer for about 30 minutes, adding salt and pepper to taste.  Be sure
not to get it too hot and overcook the beans, or they will become mushy.
