# Sweet Hot Nuts

I usually make this around Christmas time.  They are a pretty solid gift
for people that like nuts.  You can make them however spicy you want by
choosing an appropriately hot sauce to use.  Sriracha is a good choice
for a normal person level of heat.

## Ingredients

 * 2 tbsp viscous hot sauce (e.g. Sriracha, not tabasco)
 * 2 tsp water
 * 1 egg white
 * 2 lbs raw mixed nuts
 * 1 C brown sugar
 * 1 C white sugar
 * 2 sprigs rosemary

## Preparation

In a large bowl, whisk together the egg white, hot sauce, and water.
You want it lightly aerated, but not super frothy.

Toss the nuts in the mixture, making sure they are well coated.

In a separate bowl, finely chop the rosemary and mix it together with
the sugars.  Stir this mixture into the nuts and coat them as evenly as
you can.  It probably won't be all that even but that's fine.

Spread the nuts onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper and bake
for 1 hour at 250&deg;F.  Stir the nuts around every 15 minutes to get
them cooked evenly.
