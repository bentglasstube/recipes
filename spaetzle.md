# Spaetzle

This is a simple German pasta that is delicious and easy to make.  It's
easiest to make if you have a potato ricer to push the dough through,
but you could just cut the noodles if you are good with a knife.

## Ingredients

 * 4 eggs
 * 1/3 C milk
 * 2 tsp salt
 * 2 C flour
 * 4 tbsp butter (1/2 stick)
 * 1 tsp white pepper
 * 1/4 tsp nutmeg, ground
 * parsley, roughly chopped (optional)

## Preparation

Whisk together eggs, milk, and salt.  Add flour and stir until well
combined and a dough is formed.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Use a potato ricer or
colander to push the dough into small strings over the boiling water.
Let the noodles cook for a minute or two, until the float.

Remove the noodes with a slotted spoon or spider.  Toss with butter,
pepper, and nutmeg.  Optionally, garnish with parsley.
