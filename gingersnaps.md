# Gingersnaps

This recipe came from my grandmother.  Amusingly, it is almost identical
to the recipe of the jar of Grandma's brand molasses.

## Ingredients

 * 3/4 C shortening
 * 1 C sugar
 * 1/4 C dark molasses
 * 1 egg
 * 2 C flour
 * 1/4 tsp salt
 * 2 tsp baking soda
 * 1 tsp ground cloves
 * 1 tsp ground ginger
 * 1 tsp ground cinnamon
 * turbinado or other coarse sugar

## Preparation

In a stand mixer, blend together the shortening and sugar.  Once that is
mixed, add the molasses and eggs and combine well.

Sift together the flour, salt, baking soda, cloves, ginger, and
cinnamon.  Add to the stand mixer bowl and mix until uniform.

Preheat the oven to 375&deg;F.  Roll the dough into 1/2" or so balls.
Dip them in the coarse sugar and place sugar side up on a greased cookie
sheet.  Bake for 13 minutes until dark brown.
