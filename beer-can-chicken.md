# Beer Can Chicken

This is a classic and versatile BBQ recipe.  Use the chicken in other
recipes that call for cooked chicken or eat it as is.  I usually double
the recipe and make two at a time to have leftovers to put on salads and
what have you.

The beer is more of a gimmick than anything, but helps keep the chicken
moist.  It will not impart any flavor to the chicken so don't bother
using a good beer.  If you only have good beer, I suggest drinking that
and filling the empty can half full with water instead.

## Ingredients

 * 5 lb whole chicken
 * [Alan's Pork Rub](/pork-rub.html) or similar
 * salt
 * 1 can cheap beer
 * 2 tbsp chopped onion
 * 2 tbsp apple cider vinegar
 * 3 gloves garlic, minced

## Preparation

Wash and trim the chicken.  Salt the chicken, adding about 1 tsp kosher
salt per pound.  Cover with as much rub as will stick.

Drink half the beer or otherwise dispose of it.  Remove the top of the
can with a can opener.  Add the onion, vinegar, and garlic to the beer.

Slide the chicken over the beer can, ensuring that the top of the can is
entirely inside the cavity of the chicken.  Throw a little extra rub
into the top of the cavity for good measure and use the neck flap of
skin as a sort of lid on the whole thing.

Cook on the smoker or oven at 225&deg;F for 3-4 hours.  The chicken is
done when the breast and the thigh reach an internal temperature of
165&deg;F.  Remove the chicken and let it rest for 10 minutes before
carving it up and serving.
