# Baked Fries

I like making burgers at home, but my wife is disappointed about the
lack of french fries.  Frying things is a big mess, but this process
seems to work well for making baked fries that have a crispy exterior
and a fluffy interior.

For seasoning the fries, I like to use Penzy's Northwoods seasoning or
Lawry's seasoned salt.

## Ingredients

 * yukon gold potatoes
 * olive oil
 * salt
 * pepper
 * seasoning (optional)

## Preparation

Place a rimmed baking sheet on the bottom rack of a cold oven.  Preheat
the oven (with the sheet inside) to 450&deg;F.

Wash the potatoes and cut them into 1/4" sticks.  Place the sticks in a
bowl and cover with very hot tap water.  Let them soak for 10 minutes in
the hot water.

Drain and dry the potatoes thoroughly.  Toss in enough oil to thickly
coat them.  Add salt and whatever other seasoning you like to the fries
and toss again.

Brush the pre-heated baking sheet with olive oil and place the fries in
a single layer.

Bake for for 15 to 20 minutes and flip the fries over.  Bake for another
5 to 10 minutes, until golden brown.
