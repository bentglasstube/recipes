# Chuckie

This is a lesser known style of bbq but one of my favorites to make.  It is
essentially the same as pulled pork but made with a beef chuck roast instead of
a pork shoulder.  Chuck roast is a less expensive cut of meat, but there is no
sacrifice on the flavor.

## Ingredients

 * Chuck roast
 * Salt
 * Yellow mustard
 * [Alan's Pork Rub](/alans-pork-rub) or another rub without salt
 * Apple juice
 * Apple cider vinegar
 * Board sauce (optional)


## Equipment

 * Smoker
 * Spray bottle
 * Cutting board

## Preparation

You will want to get the meat out the evening before and salt it.  Unwrap the
roast and pat it dry with a paper towel.  Use about 1% of the weight of the
meat in salt and sprinkle it evenly around the outside.  Place the meat on a
cooling rack or similarly open rack to allow air to flow around it and return
it to the fridge overnight, uncovered.  This process causes the exterior of the
meat to become dry, which causes moisture within to move outward, pulling the
salt inward.  This will not dry out the meat but rather distribute the salt
evenly throughout.

Plan on the meat taking around 2 hours per pound to cook.  It's better to start
(and finish) early than late, as you can store the cooked meat in a cooler for
up to 4 hours after cooking is done if it's not yet time to serve.  You will
also want to factor in some extra time for pulling the meat, which can take 30
minutes or so if you have a lot.

Before cooking time, you will want to take your meat out of the fridge and let
it warm up some.  You can also take this time to apply the rub.  The roast
should be dry from the salting, so apply a thin layer of yellow mustard to make
the rub adhere to the meat.  Put as much rub as will stick on the roast, making
sure to cover all sides.
