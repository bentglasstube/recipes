Hello, and welcome to my digital cookbook.  This is a living book and very
much a work in progress.  Most of the cooking I do is smoking and
barbecuing, so a lot of the focus is on that.  I don't think I'm an expert
or anything but I wanted to write down my methods anyway, so I may as well
share them.
