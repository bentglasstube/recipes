# Corned Beef

For some reason I only ever make this on St. Patrick's day even though I
love corned beef.  This is just a process for preparing an already made
corned beef, the kind that come in a vaccuum packed bag.  Maybe one day
I will make my own from scratch, but it's a pretty long proccess.

## Ingredients

 * 3-4 lb corned beef brisket
 * mustard
 * [Alan's Pork Rub](/pork-rub.html) (beef variety)
 * Foil pan big enough to hold the brisket.

## Preparation

Place the brisket in the foil pan.  Cover the brisket with mustard on
one side.  Apply as much rub as will stick.  After a few minutes, the
rub will appear wet.  Flip the brisket and repeat on the other side and
the edges.

Start the smoker and set it to 250&deg;F.  Once it is up to temperature,
put the foil pan in and smoke uncovered until the brisket reaches
155&deg;F.  This gets the smoke flavor all up in there.

Cover the foil pan tightly with foil and continue to cook until the
brisket reaches 185&deg;F.  This braises the meat in the juices
collected in the pan and keeps the brisket from coming out too dry.

Uncover the pan and continue to cook until the brisket is tender.  This
usually happens when the internal temperature reaches around 195&deg;F.
But, for once, you should not rely just on the temperature.  Use a
skewer to pierce the meat.  There should be very little resistance.

Let the meat rest for 30 minutes (or insulate and rest longer) before
serving.
