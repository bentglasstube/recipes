# Board Sauce

Board sauce is something you put on the cutting board before cutting/shredding
the meat.  It adds a hint more flavor to the meat and makes you look like
you know what you are doing in the kitchen.

# Ingredients

 * olive oil
 * fresh cilantro
 * fresh thyme
 * fresh garlic
 * fresh jalape√±os
 * other peppers or herbs, as desired
 * lemon or lime

# Preparation

If you want to make something spicy, leave the seeds and veins in the
peppers.  If you don't want something spicy, take them out.  The relative
proportions of the herbs and peppers aren't really that important.  Just put
however much of each into the mix makes you feel the happiest.  Chop all the
herbs and peppers up somewhat finely and put them in a bowl.  Pour in enough
olive oil to cover everything up.  Squeeze in the juice from your lemon or
lime and mix it all together.  Let it sit so that the flavors diffuse into
the oil for several hours.

If you make too much and have some left over, it works well as a relish.
You will want to put the leftovers in the fridge though or the olive oil
will turn rancid.
