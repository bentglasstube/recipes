# Baked Beans

Kick up some normal baked beans with minimal effort.

## Ingredients

 * 8 strips of bacon
 * ½ medium onion, diced
 * ½ green bell pepper, diced
 * 2 jalapeño peppers, diced
 * 55 oz can baked beans
 * 8 oz can crushed pineapple
 * 1 cup brown sugar
 * 1 cup quality ketchup
 * 2 tsp ground mustard

## Preparation

If smoking, preheat your smoker to 225&deg;F.  If baking, preheat your oven to
350&deg;F.

If you want something less spicy, you can devein the jalapeños.  Either way it
probably won't make much difference.

Fry up the bacon strips until crispy.  Remove them from the pan, leaving the fat
behind.  Fry up the vegetables in the fat until tender.  In the meantime, chop
the bacon into small pieces.

Pour the beans, pineapple, brown sugar, ketchup, and mustard in a 12" by 9"
baking pan and combine well.  Stir in the vegetables and bacon.  If the mixture
seems too dry, add more ketchup.

Cook in the smooker for 2½ to 3 hours, until the beans reach a temperature of
160&deg;F.  Alternatively, bake for an hour.  If baking, you don't need to worry
about the temperature, as nothing will stay in the *Danger Zone* for long.
